Project Alert: Analog Watch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

🚨 New Project Alert!

I’m excited to share my latest project—an Analog Watch created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
🔧 Technologies Used:

    HTML: Structured the basic layout of the watch.
    CSS: Styled the watch, including the face, hands, and movements, to give it a realistic look.
    JavaScript: Implemented the logic to make the watch functional, allowing the hands to move according to the current time.

🕒 Project Highlights:

    Dynamic Movement: The watch's hands move in real-time, reflecting the actual time with smooth transitions.
    Responsive Design: The watch adjusts beautifully across different devices and screen sizes.
    Customizable Features: Easy to tweak colors, sizes, and styles to create your unique version of the watch.

💡 Why This Project?

This project was a fantastic way to dive deep into the basics of web development while creating something both visually appealing and functional. It’s a great blend of design and interactivity, showcasing how front-end technologies can be combined to build something cool.

Stay tuned for a demo and code repository! 🕰️
